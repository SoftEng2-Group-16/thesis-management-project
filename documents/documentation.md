## SUMMARY



## AUTH v.1.0

The authentication it's realized with passport framework, email and password are stored in the database with encrypted passwords and randomly (but manually) generated salt for the time being, since there is no registration process yet.

The Credentials have been generated using https://www.browserling.com/tools/scrypt
and can be tested with its relative counterpart tool https://www.browserling.com/tools/scrypt-check

The login is performed with email and password, the system check if there is a related email in the *auth* table that has a correspondant hashed password, then, afther authentication succeds, fetch all the info of the user from the tables *student* or *teachers*, based on the role.

## Useful ideas and future development needs

## React Client Application Routes

- Route `/thesis`: main page with the list of thesis. Different views for students and teachers
- Route `/proposal`: page with the Form to create a new thesis proposal or edit an old one
- Route `/login`: to perform login
- Route `*`: for non existing pages
## Main Component
- `Thesis Proposal`: after login it receives trough the props *All USER DATA FROM THE SESSION*, based on the role, the component shows and behaves differently.
- `Proposal Form`: This form is used to create a new Proposal adding all the necesssary field. If instead the teacher wants to update an existing proposal is sufficient to pass the old proposal object to this component.
- `ThesisProposalBro`: This component is used to show the list of all the thesis proposals to an user. It has a Selector and a Select component that permits the user to write and get suggestions for the filtering process. By choosing which filters to apply the user can get the list of thesis that satisfy  his preferences.
- `ThesisPage`: This component is used to show to an user all the important data about a thesis proposal.  If the logged user is a professor there is only a go back button (for now, later we will add the fact that we can modify it only if he is the owner). If the logged user is a student he has two buttons, one for going back and one for applyng to that specific thesis.

    ]


    

## Testing

Jest setted up for unit and integration testing.

### Implemetation for Integration

- setup process.env.NODE_ENV as 'test' in the integration test file
- import the server, which will start listening on port 3001
- the db file will create/open an in-memory db and populate it with the exported db in `thesis-management-project/code/server/db_TM.sql`
- connection to the in-memory sqlite database before every test case (in the file) start execution
- after all test cases the db is closed, the server is closed.

>*IMPORTANT*: keep the `db_TM.sql` updated as the `cleanDB/db_TM.db` is updated

### Commands

This commands are executed only on test files under `thesis-management-project/code/server/tests` directory

- `npm test`: runs all test 
- `npm test:unit`: runs only unit tests with coverage
- `npm run test:integration`: runs only integration tests with coverage
